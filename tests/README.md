# RiverObs testing steps:

All steps to be run from this directory! 

* Run `run_test_case.sh`
* Run `validate_test_case.sh`

The ```clean_test.sh``` script cleans up the files generated by the test.

# Tips on debugging `test_riverobs.py`:

* If you want to use a debugger / IPython embed within the test script, run with the `-s` option, i.e. `pytest -vs test_riverobs.py`, otherwise stdout / stdin will not work in the expected way.
